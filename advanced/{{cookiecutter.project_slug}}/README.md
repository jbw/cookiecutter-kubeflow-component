## Kubeflow Python Component Bootstrap :boot: :rocket:

This starter project should be used when developing new Kubeflow components. It implements
well accepted standards, development practices, and libraries. It's also to promote
consistent development and deployment experience from component to component to allow for ease of support, testing, and updating.

### Highlights :sparkles:

- Bootstraps the typical boilerplate when starting something new
- Solution layout for source and test code following best practices from Kubeflow and others
- Consistent code formatting and linting
